# Subagent Automation Implementation Guide

## Quick Start

The automated subagent detection system is now active! Here's how it works:

### 🤖 Automatic Detection

When you make requests, the system automatically analyzes:

1. **Your Request Text** - Scans for task-type keywords
2. **Current File Context** - What files you're working with  
3. **Recent Commands** - Build, lint, dev commands executed
4. **Task Complexity** - Multi-step vs simple tasks

### 💡 Example Automated Suggestions

#### Design Task Detection
```
User: "Can you improve the button colors to match our brand?"

🤖 Auto-detected: Visual Design Task
📋 Activating: visual_designer_subagent.md + spice_island_design_specs.md
🎨 Using: Brand color palette (burgundy-600, gold-500), cultural design elements

Proceeding with specialized design approach...
```

#### Development Task Detection
```
User: "Fix the TypeScript error in the API route"

🤖 Auto-detected: Development & Engineering Task  
📋 Activating: full_stack_developer_subagent.md + spice_island_engineering_specs.md
💻 Using: Next.js best practices, error handling patterns, type safety

Proceeding with specialized development approach...
```

#### Content Task Detection
```
User: "Write a blog post about sambal varieties"

🤖 Auto-detected: Content & SEO Task
📋 Activating: content_seo_strategist_subagent.md + spice_island_content_specs.md  
📝 Using: Cultural authenticity guidelines, SEO optimization, educational focus

Proceeding with specialized content approach...
```

## Detection Triggers

### High-Confidence Triggers
- **Keywords + File Context**: "design button" + working on `.tsx` files
- **Command Patterns**: `yarn build` → Development subagent
- **File Types**: Editing `.md` files in `/blog/` → Content subagent

### Medium-Confidence Triggers  
- **Keywords Only**: "improve analytics" → Analytics subagent
- **File Context Only**: Working on email templates → Email Marketing subagent

### Manual Override
You can always specify:
- `"Use design subagent approach"`
- `"Apply development methodology"`  
- `"Skip subagent routing"`

## Benefits You'll See

### ✅ **Automatic Expertise**
- No need to remember which subagent to use
- Always gets the right specialized approach
- Consistent brand application

### ✅ **Context Awareness**
- Understands what files you're working with
- Adapts to your current workflow
- Remembers recent commands and context

### ✅ **Quality Assurance**
- Always references project specifications
- Maintains cultural authenticity
- Applies conversion optimization principles

## Testing the System

### Test Scenarios

Try these requests to see auto-detection in action:

1. **Design**: "Update the product page colors"
2. **Development**: "Debug the checkout API"  
3. **Content**: "Create recipe content for sambal fried rice"
4. **Analytics**: "How can we track user engagement?"
5. **Email**: "Set up abandoned cart recovery emails"
6. **Customer Support**: "Improve the contact form"

### Expected Behavior

Each should automatically:
1. Detect the appropriate subagent
2. Reference the correct methodology file
3. Load relevant project specifications  
4. Apply domain-specific expertise

## Fallback & Override

### When Auto-Detection Fails
- System falls back to general approach
- You can manually specify: `"This is a [type] task"`
- Multiple matches get prioritized by confidence score

### Manual Control
- `"Use [subagent_name] approach"` - Force specific subagent
- `"Skip automation"` - Use general approach
- `"Switch to [other_subagent]"` - Change mid-task

## File Integration

The automation references these files:
- `subagent_router.md` - Detection rules and triggers
- `subagent_detector.js` - Core detection algorithm  
- Individual `*_subagent.md` - Specialized methodologies
- `spice_island_*_specs.md` - Project-specific requirements

## Status: ✅ ACTIVE

The automated subagent detection system is now implemented and ready for use. All requests will be automatically analyzed for appropriate subagent routing while maintaining the option for manual override.

**Next Steps**: Use the system naturally - it will detect task types and apply specialized approaches automatically!
