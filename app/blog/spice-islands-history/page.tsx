								<p className='text-emerald-800 leading-relaxed'>
									The story of sambal begins in the
									Maluku Islands, where centuries of
									spice cultivation and volcanic soil
									created the perfect conditions for
									developing the world's most complex
									chili condiments. This isn't just
									culinary history ‚Äì it's the
									foundation of authentic Indonesian
									flavour.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>

					<p className='text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-6'>
						Long before Europeans discovered the "Spice
						Islands," the Maluku archipelago was already the
						epicenter of a sophisticated spice culture that
						would eventually reshape global trade, cuisine,
						and history itself. These remote Indonesian
						islands, scattered across the azure waters between
						Sulawesi and Papua, were once the world's only
						source of nutmeg and cloves ‚Äì spices so valuable
						they were literally worth their weight in gold.
					</p>

					<p className='text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mb-8'>
						But while European powers fought bloody wars to
						control these precious spices, the indigenous
						peoples of Maluku were quietly perfecting
						something even more extraordinary: the art of
						sambal making. Using chilies grown in the islands'
						uniquely fertile volcanic soil, they developed
						complex condiments that captured not just heat,
						but the very essence of their homeland's terroir.

									Mineral-Rich Foundation
								</h4>
								<p className='text-sm mb-4'>
									The Maluku Islands sit on the
									Pacific Ring of Fire, where
									volcanic activity has deposited
									layers of mineral-rich ash over
									millennia. This soil contains high
									levels of potassium, phosphorus,
									and trace minerals essential for
									chili development.
								</p>

								<h4 className='font-semibold mb-2'>
									Capsaicin Development
								</h4>
								<p className='text-sm'>
									These minerals directly influence
									capsaicinoid production in chilies,
									creating not just heat, but complex

									chilies their distinctive
									character.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div className='text-red-700'>
								<h4 className='font-semibold mb-2'>
									Perfect Drainage
								</h4>
								<p className='text-sm mb-4'>
									Volcanic soil's porous structure
									provides excellent drainage while
									retaining essential nutrients,
									preventing root rot while allowing
									chilies to develop concentrated
									flavors under controlled stress.
								</p>

								<h4 className='font-semibold mb-2'>
									Climate Synergy
								</h4>
								<p className='text-sm'>
									The tropical climate combined with
									mineral-rich soil creates ideal
									conditions for slow chili
									maturation, developing complex
									aromatic compounds impossible to
									replicate elsewhere.

							Why Location Matters for Sambal
						</h3>
						<p className='text-green-800 leading-relaxed'>
							Just as French wine reflects its terroir,
							authentic Indonesian sambal carries the
							mineral signature of volcanic Maluku soil.
							This is why genuine sambal has a clean,
							bright heat rather than the harsh burn of
							industrially grown chilies. The volcanic
							minerals create natural flavor complexity
							that no amount of processing or additives can
							replicate ‚Äì it's literally the taste of
							ancient volcanic fire, captured in every jar.
