								About This Recipe
							</h2>
							<div className='prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 font-body'>
								<p>
									This Sambal Chicken Stir-Fry
									represents the perfect introduction
									to authentic Indonesian cooking.
									The key to this dish is using
									genuine sambal oelek - not a
									substitute or Western &quot;chili
									garlic sauce.&quot; Authentic
									sambal oelek provides the clean,
									intense heat and complex flavor
									that makes Indonesian cuisine so
									distinctive.
								</p>

								<h3 className='text-xl font-bold text-burgundy-900 mt-6 mb-3'>
									Why Authentic Sambal Makes a
									Difference
								</h3>
								<p>
									Traditional Indonesian sambal oelek
									is made with just three
									ingredients: fresh red chilies,
									salt, and vinegar. This simplicity
									allows the pure chili flavor to
									shine through, creating a heat that
									builds gradually and has depth.
									Western substitutes often contain
									sugar, preservatives, and
									thickeners that mask the authentic
									taste.
								</p>

									Cooking Tips for Perfect Results
								</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>
											High Heat is Essential:
										</strong>{" "}
										Indonesian stir-frying
										requires very high heat to
										achieve the characteristic
										&quot;wok hei&quot; (breath of
										the wok) flavor.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>
											Don&apos;t Overcook the
											Vegetables:
										</strong>{" "}
										They should retain some crunch
										for authentic texture.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>
											Taste and Adjust:
										</strong>{" "}
										Sambal heat can vary, so
										always taste and add more if
										needed.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>
											Serve Immediately:
										</strong>{" "}
										This dish is best enjoyed hot
										from the wok.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h3 className='text-xl font-bold text-burgundy-900 mt-6 mb-3'>
									Variations and Substitutions
								</h3>
								<p>
									While this recipe uses chicken, you
									can easily substitute with beef,
									pork, prawns, or tofu. For
									vegetables, try adding green beans,
									baby corn, or bok choy. The key is
									maintaining the balance of flavors
									and not overwhelming the dish with
									too many ingredients.
