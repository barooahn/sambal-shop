	// Cooking FAQ data for AI search optimization
	const cookingFAQ = [
		{
			question: "Can I use chicken breast instead of thigh?",
			answer: "Yes, but chicken thighs are preferred for stir-frying as they stay juicier and more flavorful during high-heat cooking. If using breast, cut it slightly thicker and don't overcook - remove it from heat as soon as it's just done to prevent dryness.",
		},
		{
			question: "How do I know when the sambal is properly bloomed?",
			answer: "You'll know the sambal is properly bloomed when it becomes very fragrant and the oil turns a deep red color. This usually takes 1-2 minutes of constant stirring over high heat. The sambal should sizzle actively but not burn.",
		},
		{
			question: "What if my stir-fry is too spicy?",
			answer: "If the dish is too spicy, serve it with extra steamed rice, cucumber slices, or a dollop of coconut cream. For future cooking, start with less sambal - you can always add more, but you can't take it away. Remember that sambal heat varies between batches.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I make this dish ahead of time?",
			answer: "Stir-fries are best served immediately for optimal texture and flavor. However, you can prep all ingredients hours ahead. Store cut vegetables and chicken separately in the refrigerator, then cook when ready to serve. Reheated stir-fry loses the characteristic 'wok hei' flavor.",

							About This Indonesian Classic
						</h2>
						<div className='prose prose-lg max-w-none text-gray-700 font-body'>
							<p>
								Ayam Rica Rica originates from North Sulawesi and represents one of Indonesia's most beloved spicy chicken dishes. Unlike Chinese-style stir-fries, this Indonesian version showcases the pure, intense heat of sambal oelek combined with aromatic vegetables and traditional seasonings.
							</p>
							<p>
								The name "Rica Rica" refers to the spicy sambal-based sauce that coats the chicken. Traditionally made with local Minahasan chilies, our recipe uses authentic sambal oelek to deliver the same fiery heat and complex flavor that makes this dish so special throughout Indonesia.

							<p>
								In Indonesia, Ayam Rica Rica is traditionally served with steamed white rice, fresh cucumber slices, and keropok (prawn crackers). The cool cucumber provides essential relief from the heat, while the crunchy prawn crackers add textural contrast.
							</p>
							<p>
								For an authentic Indonesian meal, serve this alongside gado-gado salad, sayur lodeh (vegetable curry), or our sambal fried rice. The combination creates a balanced meal with varying textures and complementary flavors.
