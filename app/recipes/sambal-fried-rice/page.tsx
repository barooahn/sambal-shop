	// Cooking FAQ data for AI search optimization
	const cookingFAQ = [
		{
			question: "How do I adjust spice levels in sambal recipes?",
			answer: "Start with 1/4 teaspoon of sambal and gradually increase to taste. You can reduce heat by adding more rice, vegetables, or a splash of coconut milk. For extra heat, add more sambal at the end of cooking. Remember that sambal heat builds, so taste as you go and let flavors develop for a minute before adding more.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I substitute sambal in recipes?",
			answer: "While sambal is unique, you can substitute with sriracha (use 3x more for similar heat) or chili garlic sauce. However, these alternatives are sweeter and less authentic. For best results, order authentic sambal online - the flavor difference is significant and worth the investment for genuine Indonesian taste.",
		},
		{
			question: "What if I can&apos;t find Indonesian ingredients?",
			answer: "Most sambal recipes work with common UK ingredients. Use jasmine rice instead of Indonesian rice, regular soy sauce instead of kecap manis (add a pinch of brown sugar), and frozen mixed vegetables if fresh aren&apos;t available. The key is authentic sambal - this makes the biggest difference in achieving genuine Indonesian flavor.",
		},
		{
			question: "How do I store leftover sambal dishes?",
			answer: "Store leftover sambal fried rice in the refrigerator for up to 3 days in an airtight container. Reheat in a wok or large pan with a splash of oil to restore texture. The flavors actually improve overnight as the sambal penetrates the rice. For food safety, cool quickly and refrigerate within 2 hours of cooking.",

							<p>
								Nasi Goreng is Indonesia&apos;s national dish
								and one of the most beloved fried rice
								recipes in the world. This version uses
								authentic Sambal Bali to create the
								perfect balance of heat, sweetness, and
								aromatic spices that make this dish so
								special.
							</p>
							<p>
								The key to great nasi goreng is using
								day-old rice and cooking over high heat.
								The sambal not only provides heat but
								also acts as the flavor base that ties
								all the ingredients together. Unlike
								Chinese fried rice, Indonesian nasi
								goreng has a distinctive sweet-spicy
								profile that comes from the combination
								of sambal and sweet soy sauce.
