		{
			question: "What is Indonesian sambal?",
			answer: "Indonesian sambal is a traditional chili-based condiment that's the heart and soul of Indonesian cuisine. Unlike Western hot sauces, sambal is made with fresh ingredients using ancient techniques passed down through generations. It's not just about heat - it's about complex flavor layers that enhance every dish. From the volcanic soils of the Spice Islands comes this authentic taste that transforms ordinary meals into extraordinary culinary experiences.",
		},
		{
			question: "Where does sambal come from?",
			answer: "Sambal originates from the Indonesian archipelago, particularly the Maluku Islands (Spice Islands), where volcanic soil creates ideal conditions for growing the world's most flavorful chilies. The tradition dates back centuries, long before European traders arrived in 1512. Each region of Indonesia has developed its own unique sambal varieties, with techniques refined over generations using traditional stone mortars and time-honored recipes.",
		},
		{
			question: "Is sambal healthy?",
			answer: "Yes! Authentic sambal is incredibly healthy when made with traditional methods. Fresh chilies are rich in vitamin C, capsaicin (which boosts metabolism), and antioxidants. Our sambal contains no artificial preservatives, colors, or excessive sodium like many commercial hot sauces. The natural fermentation process and minimal ingredients create a condiment that supports digestive health and provides natural anti-inflammatory benefits.",
		},
		{
			question: "Can I buy authentic Indonesian sambal in the UK?",
			answer: "Absolutely! We're the UK's premier Indonesian sambal supplier. Made by Chef Yossie using traditional Bandung family recipes, our sambal is crafted with the same techniques used in Indonesia for generations. We deliver throughout the UK including London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh with proper packaging to maintain freshness. Unlike mass-produced alternatives found in UK supermarkets, our sambal contains no artificial ingredients and captures the true taste of Indonesia.",
		},
		{
			question: "Do you deliver Indonesian sambal to London and Manchester?",
			answer: "Yes! We deliver authentic Indonesian sambal throughout the UK with next-day delivery available to London, Manchester, Birmingham, Edinburgh and all major cities. Free UK delivery on orders over Â£25. Our sambal is carefully packaged to maintain freshness during transport, ensuring you receive restaurant-quality Indonesian condiments at your door.",
		},
		{
			question: "Where can I find authentic Indonesian sambal near me in the UK?",
			answer: "Spice Island Indonesia is your best source for authentic Indonesian sambal in the UK.
